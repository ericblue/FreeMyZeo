# Project: FreeMyZeo - Export MyZeo Sleep Data 

[Overview]

This service will allow MyZeo users to download a copy of their sleep data using the Perl port (WebService::Zeo) of the published Zeo API. 
If you've already uploaded or synced your Zeo sleep data, you might be in luck! This is similar to the feature offered directly on the Zeo site, 
however given the uncertain future of Zeo, it's useful to have another service that will remain up if Zeo's main website goes down. 
This does obviously still rely on the Zeo API being available, but as of the last few days the main myzeo.com website was throwing server errors, 
while the API service remained up.
